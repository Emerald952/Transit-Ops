# TransitOps — Smart Transport Operations Platform

TransitOps is a centralized fleet and transport operations platform that digitizes vehicle registration, driver management, trip dispatching, maintenance logs, fuel refilling, and operational expense tracking. 

Built as a lightweight, modular system for the Odoo Hackathon.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Dashboard**: Displays real-time KPIs (Active/Available Vehicles, In Maintenance, Active/Pending Trips, Drivers on Duty, and Fleet Utilization %).
- **Vehicle Registry**: CRUD operations for fleet vehicles, tracking load capacities, odometers, and active states.
- **Driver Rosters**: Profiles with license categories, safety scores, contact numbers, and license expiry checking.
- **Trip Lifecycle**: Dispatch, complete, or cancel trips. Automatically synchronizes vehicle/driver states.
- **Maintenance Logs**: Creates maintenance records, takes vehicles "In Shop", resolves repairs, and logs maintenance cost receipts.
- **Financial Refills & Expenses**: Log general expenses (tolls, insurance, maintenance, other) and fuel refill volumes.
- **Business Intelligence**: Computes overall fuel efficiency, operating costs, and calculates individual vehicle ROI: `[Revenue - (Maintenance + Fuel)] / Acquisition Cost`.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Enforced both client-side (UI visibility per role) and server-side (API routes reject unauthorized roles).
- **Aesthetics & Dark Mode**: Modern slate-indigo theme supporting instant light/dark toggle and CSV exports.

## 🚦 Business Rules Enforced

1. **Unique Registrations**: Vehicle plates and driver licenses must be unique.
2. **Availability Check**: Vehicles *Retired* or *In Shop* and drivers *Suspended* or *Off Duty* are hidden from dispatch selectors.
3. **Expired Licenses**: Drivers with past-due licenses are blocked from new trips.
4. **Capacity Thresholds**: Prevents dispatching trips where the cargo weight exceeds the assigned vehicle's max load capacity.
5. **Odometer Tracking**: Odometer readings must increase on trip completion.
6. **Automatic Status Propagations**:
   - Dispatching a trip sets vehicle and driver statuses to `on_trip`.
   - Completing/cancelling a trip restores vehicle and driver statuses to `available`.
   - Logging maintenance sets vehicle status to `in_shop`. Closing maintenance restores vehicle to `available`.
   - Completing trips/closing maintenance auto-files corresponding fuel/maintenance expenses.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Backend (Express & PostgreSQL)
1. Ensure you have **Node.js** and **PostgreSQL** installed.
2. Create a PostgreSQL database named `transitops`.
3. Load the schema:
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres -d transitops -f backend/db.sql
   ```
4. (Optional) Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust DB/JWT settings if not using the local defaults.
5. Install dependencies and run the seed script:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run seed
   ```
6. Start the API server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   *(Runs on http://localhost:3000)*

### Frontend (Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)
- The frontend is a single-page app served directly by the Express backend.
- Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser once the backend is running.
- **Note**: A live connection to the backend API is required — login and all data (vehicles, drivers, trips, maintenance, fuel, expenses) are served from PostgreSQL.
